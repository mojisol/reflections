Question 1
When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer 
When you do not mind it being modified and let others see what your project is all about.

Question 2
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer
Some of the changes maybe desired or undesired so doing it manually gives you the choice of choosing what changes you prefer to be there.

Question 3
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Answer
Fork: It is use to make a copy of another repository on your repository
clone: It is used to make a copy of a repository from Github into your local directory
Branch: When you want to make changes in you local directory without affecting the original file
